## **Project Overview**

### Can you give an overview of your recent project?

**FinNami** is an AI-driven financial advisor platform designed to democratize wealth management. It combines advanced machine learning for personalized investment recommendations, conversational AI for financial assistance, and robust security for financial transactions. The platform offers end-to-end services: from user onboarding and KYC to portfolio management and fraud detection.

### What was the purpose of the project, and how did it solve the problem?

The purpose of FinNami was to address two significant problems in the financial advisory space:

* **Limited access to personalized financial advice** for small investors.
* **Security risks** and fraud in online financial transactions.

FinNami solves these by:

* Using ensemble ML models to deliver personalized investment recommendations based on each userâ€™s risk profile.
* Implementing a conversational AI for real-time financial guidance.
* Incorporating robust KYC, 2FA, and anomaly detection to secure transactions and data.

### What technologies did you use, and why?

* **Backend**: Django REST, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyOD, Celery

  * Django REST offers rapid API development and strong security.
  * Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM are powerful for building ensemble ML models.
  * PyOD specializes in detecting financial anomalies for fraud prevention.
  * Celery manages asynchronous tasks like background KYC verification.
* **Frontend**: Next.js, Ant Design, Recharts, React Query

  * Next.js provides server-side rendering for speed and SEO.
  * Ant Design offers a clean, professional UI component library.
  * Recharts visualizes financial data in interactive charts.
  * React Query optimizes API data fetching and caching.
* **Database**: MongoDB, Redis

  * MongoDBâ€™s flexibility suits dynamic financial data structures.
  * Redis accelerates caching and session management.
* **Security**: JWT, OAuth 2.0, PyOTP

  * Ensures secure authentication and user sessions.
* **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines

  * Enables scalable, containerized deployments.

## **Challenges & Solutions**

### What were the biggest challenges you faced during the project?

* Ensuring **low-latency recommendations** for ML models, despite the large feature sets.
* Designing a **secure transaction system** capable of detecting sophisticated fraud patterns.
* Integrating conversational AI without sacrificing response speed.

### How did you handle performance bottlenecks or scaling issues?

* Implemented **Celery workers** for heavy ML predictions asynchronously.
* Optimized ensemble models via feature selection and model compression.
* Used **Redis caching** to store frequent API responses.
* Deployed services using Kubernetes for auto-scaling under load.

### Describe a time when something went wrong. How did you resolve it?

During integration of the ML models, we encountered memory errors due to large data frames. We resolved it by:

* Switching from in-memory Pandas operations to **incremental learning techniques**.
* Breaking data into smaller batches.
* Utilizing efficient serialization formats like Parquet.

## **Technical Stack**

### Why did you choose this particular stack for your project?

* Django REST is robust for API-driven backends.
* Next.js offers SEO-friendly frontends crucial in fintech.
* ML libraries like Scikit-learn and XGBoost are proven for financial data.
* MongoDB fits dynamic, semi-structured financial data.
* Kubernetes and Docker ensure seamless deployments and scaling.

### What design patterns or architectural decisions did you follow?

* **Microservices architecture**: Backend services for KYC, ML, and chat are separate for modularity and scalability.
* **Domain-driven design** for clear separation of financial domains.
* **Event-driven architecture** with Celery for background processing.

### How did you ensure security in your application?

* **JWT and OAuth 2.0** for authentication.
* **2FA** using PyOTP for user logins.
